TYPE ANNOTATION:
-----------------

Dictionaries often aren't strongly typed. We can create Typed Dict using classes (Ref1.py)
    - type safety
    - enhanced readability, easier to debug

Union: allows the passing of different types (almost like polymorphism in Java?) (Ref1.py)
    - flexible

Optional: basically what it sounds, can pass in a str or nothing (Ref1.py)
    - if you designate it as str, but it can also be none

Any: anything and everything is allowed

Lambda func: mini functions essentially (Ref1.py)


ELEMENTS:
-------------------

State: shared data struc, that holds current info or context
    - its like the application's memory, that keeps track of var and data that nodes can access and modify

Nodes: individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the graph
    - each node receives inputs, process it, and produces an output or updated state

Graph: overarching structure, maps the diff tasks for the nodes
    - shows the workflow and sequence between operations

Edges: connection between nodes

Conditional Edge: specialized nodes that decide the next node to be executed based on conditions

Start: marks where virtual entry point in LangGraph

End: signifies conclusion of workflow, graph's execution stops

Tools: specialized func or utils that nodes can utilized to perform tasks (fetching data from api)
    - tools are fucntionalities used within nodes

ToolNode: special node whose main job is to run a tool
    - connects tool's output back to the State so other nodes can use the updated info

StateGraph: a class in LangGraph used to build and compile the graph structure
    - manages the node, edges, and overall state, ensuring workflow operated in a unified way
      and that data flows correctly between components

Runnable: standardized, executable component that performs a specific task

Messages: 
    - Human: inputs from a user
    - System: used to provide instructions or context to the model
    - Function: Represents the results of a fuction call
    - AI: responses generated by AI model
    - Tool: Similar to function, but specific to tool usage
